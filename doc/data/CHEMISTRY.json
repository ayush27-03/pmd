Derived from renewable algal biomass, these biolubricants are biodegradable, non-toxic, and have a lower environmental footprint, thereby reducing pollution and contributing to cleaner air, water, and soil. For society, this means improved public health and a reduced risk of harmful chemical exposure, particularly in agricultural and urban settings where lubricant runoff is common. In the industrial sector, algae-based biolubricants can enhance machinery performance through superior lubricity, thermal stability, and longer service life, leading to reduced maintenance costs and energy consumption. Additionally, the cultivation and processing of algae for lubricant production can create green jobs and promote rural development, aligning with circular economy principles. As industries move toward decarbonization and sustainable practices, algae-based biolubricants present a promising solution that bridges environmental responsibility with economic growth."
