This project seeks to address this issue by designing an AI-driven smart waste management system that integrates computer vision, IoT technologies, environmental sustainability principles, and economic feasibility models. This is inherently an interdisciplinary problem, requiring collaboration across:\r\n\r\nComputer Science: to develop machine learning models for real-time waste classification and predictive analytics for collection route optimization.\r\nElectronics/IoT: to design and deploy sensor networks for tracking bin fill levels and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, odor, gas emissions).\r\nEnvironmental Science: to guide the system design towards environmentally sustainable practices and compliance with urban waste disposal regulations.\r\nBusiness/Management: to analyze operational viability, cost-benefit structures, and propose models for municipal partnerships and smart city integration."
