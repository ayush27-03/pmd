The integration of nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, TiO‚ÇÇ nanoparticles, ZnO nanorods, quantum dots) into various layers of solar cells has emerged as a promising solution to enhance optical absorption, charge separation, and transport.\r\n\r\nThis study proposes to simulate the incorporation of different nanomaterials into solar cell architectures using SCAPS-1D, a numerical modeling tool for analyzing the electrical performance of semiconductor devices.

It acknowledges that traditional financial models often overlook the powerful influence of human psychology, leading to suboptimal choices and heightened stress. By drawing upon principles from behavioral finance, such as cognitive biases, heuristics, and emotional influences, the project seeks to understand why individuals deviate from rational financial behavior.\r\n\r\nCrucially, it integrates these financial insights with psychological wisdom, recognizing the bidirectional relationship between financial health and mental state. The aim is to move beyond simply identifying problematic behaviors and instead develop actionable, behavior-based interventions. These interventions are designed not only to guide individuals towards more prudent financial decisions but also, critically, to alleviate the associated mental burden of financial stress. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary endeavor promises a pathway to improved financial literacy, reduced anxiety, and enhanced overall mental well-being.",

    "description": "Urban waste management remains a persistent challenge due to inefficiencies in waste categorization, collection logistics, and environmental impact monitoring. This project seeks to address this issue by designing an AI-driven smart waste management system that integrates computer vision, IoT technologies, environmental sustainability principles, and economic feasibility models. This is inherently an interdisciplinary problem, requiring collaboration across:\r\n\r\nComputer Science: to develop machine learning models for real-time waste classification and predictive analytics for collection route optimization.\r\nElectronics/IoT: to design and deploy sensor networks for tracking bin fill levels and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, odor, gas emissions).\r\nEnvironmental Science: to guide the system design towards environmentally sustainable practices and compliance with urban waste disposal regulations.\r\nBusiness/Management: to analyze operational viability, cost-benefit structures, and propose models for municipal partnerships and smart city integration.",
